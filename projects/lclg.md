title: '42tm''s Linux Command Line Guide'
---

From 2018 to 2019, I wrote an e-book on Linux command line basics for absolute
beginners. [Here's the GitHub repository of it if you're interested.][link] I
wrote the content, designed the layout, created the chapter quizzes, and made
illustrations, some of which are shown below. The book is owned and hosted by my
programming team, [42tm](https://github.com/42tm). The book, along with its
illustrations, is in the public domain, and you are welcome to contribute!
