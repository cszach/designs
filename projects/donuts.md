title: 'Donuts'
---

I'm big on donuts myself, and although I do not really have many chances to
taste them at my boarding school, I certainly always enjoy a chocolate doughnut
with lots of sprinkles on top on the weekends. Here are some eye-candies for
donut lovers and non-lovers! Enjoy! :doughnut:

I made all of these using Microsoft Paint 3D, by the way. I realize I might have
abused the software to make an unhealthy number of donuts. Below are just the
ones I like best (which I have also posted on
[my Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/thechonkypenguin)).
