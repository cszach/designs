# Hi there! I'm Duong.

I am a high school senior with a lot of dreams.

I taught myself graphics design through a book I found in the school library.
For the past 3 years in high school, I have been using the knowledge I acquired
in various projects&mdash;logos, websites, illustrations, random art, etc. It
has certainly complemented my open-source projects very well, and gave
opportunities to learn from and work with peers who share the same interest.

My biggest dream is to use technology for artistic pursuits. I seek to create
digital art, first for the Web, then for desktop apps, then for physical art
installations&mdash;escaping the bounds of the computer screen. Graphics design
has shaped my view of colors, shapes, and abstraction&mdash;assets that will
serve me in my lifelong endeavors.

On this website, you will find many of my projects&mdash;projects for different
people, different purposes, and different medium. As I continue to discover art
and design with diversity at heart, this collection will only grow.
